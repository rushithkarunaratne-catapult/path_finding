# path_finding
Illustratative path finder that uses A star and pygame
Instructions for use - *press space on a sqaure for start point (yellow)
                     - *press up key for the goal (red)
                     - *mouse click for barriers (green)
Close the pygame window to get path(should change that).
Does not work for very large grid sizes due to A star complexity, the implemented data structures and heuristic(manhattan)
