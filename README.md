# path_finding
Illustratative path finder that uses A star and pygame
Instructions for use 
     
     press space on a sqaure for start point (yellow)
         
     press up key for the goal (red)
                     
    Close the pygame window to get path (Needs fixing).
    
Does not work for very large grid sizes due to A star complexity, and the fact that I was not as experienced when I did this. I would definetely consider using more efficient data structures if I were to redo this project.

But, it finds a path quite well for reasonable grid sizes/distances.
